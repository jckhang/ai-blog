## 核心内容

[Diffusion models](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/) have demonstrated strong results on image synthesis in past years. Now the research community has started working on a harder task&mdash;using it for video generation. The task itself is a superset of the image case, since an image is a video of 1 frame, and it is much more challenging because:

<ol>
- It has extra requirements on temporal consistency across frames in time, which naturally demands more world knowledge to be encoded into the model.

- In comparison to text or images, it is more difficult to collect large amounts of high-quality, high-dimensional video data, let along text-video pairs.

</ol>
