Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) glove technology is increasingly important for professional training, industrial applications, and teleoperation in hazardous environments, since it enables more natural and immersive interactions than controllers. However, current solutions face a trade-off: high-precision gloves lack haptic feedback, while haptic gloves suffer from poor accuracy. Existing studies have mainly focused on developing new glove prototypes or optimizing only one type of glove, without addressing the integration of both features. Our work presents a novel hybrid approach that combines a high-precision glove with a haptic glove, creating a system that delivers both precision and haptics.
