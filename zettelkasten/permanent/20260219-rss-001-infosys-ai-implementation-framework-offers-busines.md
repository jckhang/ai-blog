As a large provider of technology services operating in multiple industries, Infosys is one of the names that quickly come to mind when decision-makers consider possible providers of consultation on and practical implementation of any AI project – discrete or organisation-wide. Infosys delivers these services through its [Topaz Fabric](https://www.infosys.com/services/data-ai-topaz.html), leveraging its partnerships with specific AI technology providers.

It reports that it is currently working on AI implementations with 90% of its top 200 clients and has more than 4,600 AI projects in progress. The company’s strategy for AI implementation organisation-wide looks at six areas affected and considered during projects.

**AI strategy and engineering** focuses on designing and implementing AI strategies and architectures aligned to specific business objectives. These include the orchestration of AI agents, proprietary platforms, and third-party tools on infrastructure especially configured for AI workloads. An overarching strategy will lead to a consistent, enterprise AI-first operating model.

**Data for AI** addresses the preparation of enterprise data, covering structured and unstructured data and processes in this area include the development of AI-ready data platforms. Infosys refers to “AI-grade” data engineering practices such as data fingerprinting and synthetic training data services. The intention is to convert siloed data assets into reliable inputs for analytics and predictive systems.

**Process AI** concentrates on integrating AI agents into business processes, redesigning workflows if necessary so AI agents and human employees can work better together. The aim is to improve operational efficiency in general, regardless of business function.

**Legacy modernisation** applies AI agents in the analysis and interpretation of the existing technology stack and potentially reverse-engineering legacy systems to better stage AI modernisation projects. The overall aim is to reduce technical debt and offer a greater responsiveness when AI is unleashed.

**Physical AI** extends into products and devices in the workplace. This involves embedding AI into hardware systems such as those that collect sensor data, interpret that data, and act in the physical world. This broad definition encompasses digital twins, robotics, autonomous systems, and edge computing. In short, it’s the integration of digital intelligence and physical operations.

**AI trust** covers governance, security, and ethics, and includes consideration of risk assessment frameworks, policy development, AI testing, and overall technology lifecycle management.

### Lessons for business leaders

Although business leaders may be already in partnership with alternative service providers other than Infosys, the company’s strategy of demarcating the necessary action areas for AI implementations offers significant value. The six areas described provide practical reference points that can be used in any organisation to plan projects or perhaps monitor and assess ongoing implementation efforts.

Among these, data preparation is central. AI systems depend on data quality and consistency, so investment in data platforms, data governance, and engineering practices that support models is central tenet on which AI initiatives are built.

Embedding AI into workflows means it’s sometimes necessary to redesign the way employees work. Leaders should be aware of how AI agents and employees interact, and measure performance improvements. Changes can be made both to the technologies deployed and the working methods that have existed to date. If the latter, retraining and educating affected employees will be necessary, with accompanying costs.

The issue of legacy systems requires careful attention as many organisations operate complex estates that limit the agility necessary for AI to improve operations. AI tools themselves can help to analyse existing dependencies and even plan modernisation, implemented, ideally, over several stages or in separate sprints.

Physical operations intersect increasingly with digital systems. For companies with physical products, such as in manufacturing or logistics, embedding AI into devices and equipment can improve monitoring and devices’ responsiveness. This will require coordination between IT, OT, engineering, and operational teams, and line-of-business leaders should be consulted in particular.

Governance should accompany any scale of AI implementation. Risk assessment, security testing, security policy formulation, and the design of AI-specific guardrails should be established early on. Regulatory scrutiny of AI is increasing, particularly in sectors handling sensitive data, and statutory penalties apply for data loss or mismanagement, regardless of its source – AI or otherwise – in the enterprise. Clear accountability structures and documentation reduce these risks to operations and reputation.

Taken together, these areas indicate that AI implementation is organisational rather than purely technical. Success depends on leadership alignment, sustained investment, and realistic assessment of any capability gaps. Claims of rapid transformation should be treated cautiously, and durable results are more likely when strategy, data, process design, modernisation, operational integration, and governance are addressed in parallel.
