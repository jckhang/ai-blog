## 核心内容

arXiv:2602.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous models have shown great success in the fields of speech recognition as well as speech synthesis, but models for speech to speech processing have not been heavily explored. We propose Speech to Speech Synthesis Network (STSSN), a model based on current state of the art systems that fuses the two disciplines in order to perform effective speech to speech style transfer for the purpose of voice impersonation. We show that our proposed model is quite powerful, and succeeds in generating realistic audio samples despite a number of drawbacks in its capacity. We benchmark our proposed model by comparing it with a generative adversarial model which accomplishes a similar task, and show that ours produces more convincing results.
