# BamaER: A Behavior-Aware Memory-Augmented Model for Exercise Recommendation

> arXiv:2602.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.
