# COGITAO: A Visual Reasoning Framework To Study Compositionality & Generalization

> arXiv:2509.05249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28 interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to support continued research in this field.
