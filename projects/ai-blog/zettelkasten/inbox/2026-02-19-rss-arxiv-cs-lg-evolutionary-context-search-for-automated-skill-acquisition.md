# Evolutionary Context Search for Automated Skill Acquisition

> arXiv:2602.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models cannot reliably acquire new knowledge post-deployment -- even when relevant text resources exist, models fail to transform them into actionable knowledge without retraining. Retrieval-Augmented Generation attempts to bridge this gap by surfacing relevant documents at inference time, yet similarity-based retrieval often fails to identify context that actually improves task performance. We introduce Evolutionary Context Search (ECS), an evolutionary method that searches context combinations using accuracy on a small development set, requiring only inference calls without weight updates. ECS moves beyond semantic similarity to discover non-obvious context pairings that significantly boost performance. Our empirical results show that ECS improves BackendBench by 27\% and $\tau$-bench airline by 7\%. The evolved contexts are model-agnostic, as those evolved with Gemini-3-Flash transfer effectively to Claude Sonnet and DeepSeek. This suggests that ECS opens a path toward automated context discovery for skill acquisition -- an efficient alternative to manual prompt engineering or costly fine-tuning.
