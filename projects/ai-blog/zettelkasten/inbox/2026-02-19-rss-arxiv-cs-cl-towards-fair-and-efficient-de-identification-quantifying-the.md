# Towards Fair and Efficient De-identification: Quantifying the Efficiency and Generalizability of De-identification Approaches

> arXiv:2602.15869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical de-identification, the task of identifying sensitive identifiers to protect privacy. However, previous work has not examined their generalizability between formats, cultures, and genders. In this work, we systematically evaluate fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, ClinicalBERT, ModernBERT), small LLMs (Llama 1-8B, Qwen 1.5-7B), and large LLMs (Llama-70B, Qwen-72B) at de-identification. We show that smaller models achieve comparable performance while substantially reducing inference cost, making them more practical for deployment. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller models can be fine-tuned with limited data to outperform larger models in de-identifying identifiers drawn from Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Bengali, and regional variations of English, in addition to gendered names. To improve robustness in multi-cultural contexts, we introduce and publicly release BERT-MultiCulture-DEID, a set of de-identification models based on BERT, ClinicalBERT, and ModernBERT, fine-tuned on MIMIC with identifiers from multiple language variants. Our findings provide the first comprehensive quantification of the efficiency-generalizability trade-off in de-identification and establish practical pathways for fair and efficient clinical de-identification.
