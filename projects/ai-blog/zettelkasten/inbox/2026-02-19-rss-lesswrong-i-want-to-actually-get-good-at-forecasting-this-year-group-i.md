# I want to actually get good at forecasting this year (Group Invite)

> Published on February 19, 2026 1:41 AM GMT<br/><br/><p>I’ve read <i>Superforecasting</i>, but I find that actually applying the "<a href="https://fs.blog/ten-commandments-for-superforecasters/">10 commandments</a>" is difficult in isolation. The feedback loops in the real world are too slow, and it’s too easy to skip post-mortems when no one is watching.</p><p>My goal for this year is to put in substantial work to become a superforecaster (or at least get much closer).</p><p>To do this, I am starting a dedicated online community for peer accountability and high-frequency practice. I’m looking for a small cohort of people who want to actually improve their forecasting skills.</p><p><strong>The Plan:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Regular Meetups:</strong> We will hold regular video calls (ideally weekly, depending on interest).</li><li><strong>Post-mortems:</strong> We will present post-mortems of our misses during meetups or publish them as joint posts on LessWrong.</li><li><strong>Expert Insight:</strong> I plan to arrange calls with a few (super)forecasters in my network to discuss their workflows.</li><li><strong>Pastcasting:</strong> We will use <a href="https://www.quantifiedintuitions.org/pastcasting/faq">Sage</a> to forecast on historical events (where the answer is hidden) and immediately discuss our results and process.</li><li><strong>Training</strong> various relevant rationalist techniques/tools - calibration, CFAR techniques, AI tools useful for forecasting etc.</li><li><strong>Community:</strong> We will coordinate via a public <a href="https://discord.gg/9JFAg2CjGM">Discord</a> group.</li></ul><p><strong>Commitment:</strong> There are no hard requirements to join, but I am looking for people willing to:</p><ol><li>Make several forecasts per week.</li><li>Actually show up to meetups (or Discord) and discuss their post-mortems. </li></ol><p>I’d like to hold the first meetup in the coming weeks, during which we will do short calibration excersize + pastcasting. <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/?35106607-lo9H4">Please indicate your interest in this form</a> and join <a href="https://discord.gg/9JFAg2CjGM">Discord</a>. Date of the first meetup will be also announced on lesswrong event section.</p><p>(Open to other ideas on how to structure this—let me know in the comments).</p><h3><strong>A little info about me</strong></h3><p>In the past, I helped organize a forecasting tournament for the <a href="https://www.ceskepriority.cz/en">Czech Priorities</a>, which had almost 200 participants. I am board member or <a href="https://confido.institute/">Confido institute</a>. Until last year, I was vice-president of Effective Altruism Czechia on CBG grant. I made a few dozen forecasts, but mostly to build the habit rather than to rigorously invest time in improving my skills—consequently, my actual score is abysmal right now.</p><br/><br/><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jronsvchwjB74BDEb/i-want-to-actually-get-good-at-forecasting-this-year-group#comments">Discuss</a>
