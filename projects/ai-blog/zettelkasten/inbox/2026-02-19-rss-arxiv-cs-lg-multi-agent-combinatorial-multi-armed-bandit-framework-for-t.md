# Multi-Agent Combinatorial-Multi-Armed-Bandit framework for the Submodular Welfare Problem under Bandit Feedback

> arXiv:2602.16183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the \emph{Submodular Welfare Problem} (SWP), where items are partitioned among agents with monotone submodular utilities to maximize the total welfare under \emph{bandit feedback}. Classical SWP assumes full value-oracle access, achieving $(1-1/e)$ approximations via continuous-greedy algorithms. We extend this to a \emph{multi-agent combinatorial bandit} framework (\textsc{MA-CMAB}), where actions are partitions under full-bandit feedback with non-communicating agents. Unlike prior single-agent or separable multi-agent CMAB models, our setting couples agents through shared allocation constraints. We propose an explore-then-commit strategy with randomized assignments, achieving $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret against a $(1-1/e)$ benchmark, the first such guarantee for partition-based submodular welfare problem under bandit feedback.
