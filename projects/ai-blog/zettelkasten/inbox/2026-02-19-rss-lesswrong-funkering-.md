# Funkering!

> Published on February 19, 2026 6:14 PM GMT<br/><br/><p>Staring into the abyss of nuclear winter/power grid collapse/drone war has um a big <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields">ugh field</a>. Here is a psychological hack to be approach the topic: funkering = fun + bunkering! 🤸‍♂️</p>
<p>What if camping gear and portable food supplies are needed to go to a <a href="https://burningman.org/global-events-groups/find-a-burning-man-event/">local burn</a>? As a bonus you can get into sewing or electronics for making outfits or building wood structures for a camp. Not to mention dealing with human drama — I imagine there can be a lot of that for surviours.</p>
<p>What if off-grid shelter is a summer cabin with a fireplace near a lake? Growing heirloom tomatoes and canning is practice for food preservation.</p>
<p>Go to a shooting and/or archery lesson. Learn how to play a (portable) musical instrument. Take up pottery. Forage.</p>
<p>Black out date night! Make sure you have some playing cards and dice.</p>
<p>Comment with more funkering activities :)</p>
