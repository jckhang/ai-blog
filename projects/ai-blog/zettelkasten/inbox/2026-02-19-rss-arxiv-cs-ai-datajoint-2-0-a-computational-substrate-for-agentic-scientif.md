# DataJoint 2.0: A Computational Substrate for Agentic Scientific Workflows

> arXiv:2602.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operational rigor determines whether human-agent collaboration succeeds or fails. Scientific data pipelines need the equivalent of DevOps -- SciOps -- yet common approaches fragment provenance across disconnected systems without transactional guarantees. DataJoint 2.0 addresses this gap through the relational workflow model: tables represent workflow steps, rows represent artifacts, foreign keys prescribe execution order. The schema specifies not only what data exists but how it is derived -- a single formal system where data structure, computational dependencies, and integrity constraints are all queryable, enforceable, and machine-readable. Four technical innovations extend this foundation: object-augmented schemas integrating relational metadata with scalable object storage, semantic matching using attribute lineage to prevent erroneous joins, an extensible type system for domain-specific formats, and distributed job coordination designed for composability with external orchestration. By unifying data structure, data, and computational transformations, DataJoint creates a substrate for SciOps where agents can participate in scientific workflows without risking data corruption.
