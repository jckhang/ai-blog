# DIAL: Direct Iterative Adversarial Learning for Realistic Multi-Turn Dialogue Simulation

> arXiv:2512.20773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating multi-turn dialogue systems, yet creating simulators that accurately replicate human behavior remains a significant challenge. An effective simulator must expose the failure modes of the systems under evaluation. This work introduces Direct Iterative Adversarial Learning (DIAL), a DPO-based adversarial training framework that iteratively enhances user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. When applied to mental health support, a domain characterized by diverse failure types and a critical dependence on realistic user behavior for failure detection, DIAL restores lexical diversity diminished by supervised fine-tuning and reduces discriminator accuracy from near-perfect to near-random levels. The resulting simulator exhibits a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. These findings indicate that DIAL is a promising method for developing realistic user simulators in multi-turn dialogue, facilitating rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation prior to deployment.
