# Amortized Bayesian Workflow

> arXiv:2409.04332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian inference often faces a trade-off between computational speed and sampling accuracy. We propose an adaptive workflow that integrates rapid amortized inference with gold-standard MCMC techniques to achieve a favorable combination of both speed and accuracy when performing inference on many observed datasets. Our approach uses principled diagnostics to guide the choice of inference method for each dataset, moving along the Pareto front from fast amortized sampling via generative neural networks to slower but guaranteed-accurate MCMC when needed. By reusing computations across steps, our workflow synergizes amortized and MCMC-based inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated approach on several synthetic and real-world problems with tens of thousands of datasets, showing efficiency gains while maintaining high posterior quality.
