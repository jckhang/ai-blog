# MoDE-Boost: Boosting Shared Mobility Demand with Edge-Ready Prediction Models

> arXiv:2602.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.
