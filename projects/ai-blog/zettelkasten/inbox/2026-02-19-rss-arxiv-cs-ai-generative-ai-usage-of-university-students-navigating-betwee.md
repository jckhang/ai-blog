# Generative AI Usage of University Students: Navigating Between Education and Business

> arXiv:2602.16307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) usage of university students who study alongside their professional career. Previous literature has paid little attention to part-time students and the intersectional use of GenAI between education and business. This study examines with a grounded theory approach the characteristics of GenAI usage of part-time students. Eleven students from a distance learning university were interviewed. Three causal and four intervening conditions, as well as strategies were identified, to influence the use of GenAI. The study highlights both the potential and challenges of GenAI usage in education and business. While GenAI can significantly enhance productivity and learning outcomes, concerns about ethical implications, reliability, and the risk of academic misconduct persist. The developed grounded model offers a comprehensive understanding of GenAI usage among students, providing valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and developers of GenAI tools seeking to bridge the gap between education and business.
