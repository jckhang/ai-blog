# Inverting Non-Injective Functions with Twin Neural Network Regression

> arXiv:2601.05378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-injective functions are not globally invertible. However, they can often be restricted to locally injective subdomains where the inversion is well-defined. In many settings a preferred solution can be selected even when multiple valid preimages exist or input and output dimensions differ. This manuscript describes a natural reformulation of the inverse learning problem for non-injective functions as a collection of locally invertible problems. More precisely, Twin Neural Network Regression is trained to predict local inverse corrections around known anchor points. By anchoring predictions to points within the same locally invertible region, the method consistently selects a valid branch of the inverse. In contrast to current probabilistic state-of-the art inversion methods, Inverse Twin Neural Network Regression is a deterministic framework for resolving multi-valued inverse mappings. I demonstrate the approach on problems that are defined by mathematical equations or by data, including multi-solution toy problems and robot arm inverse kinematics.
