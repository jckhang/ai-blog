# When Algorithms Meet Artists: Semantic Compression of Artists' Concerns in the Public AI-Art Debate

> arXiv:2508.03037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artists occupy a paradoxical position in generative AI: their work trains the models reshaping creative labor. We tested whether their concerns achieve proportional representation in public discourse shaping AI governance. Analyzing public AI-art discourse (news, podcasts, legal filings, research; 2013--2025) and projecting 1,259 survey-derived artist statements into this semantic space, we find stark compression: 95% of artist concerns cluster in 4 of 22 discourse topics, while 14 topics (62% of discourse) contain no artist perspective. This compression is selective - governance concerns (ownership, transparency) are 7x underrepresented; affective themes (threat, utility) show only 1.4x underrepresentation after style controls. The pattern indicates semantic, not stylistic, marginalization. These findings demonstrate a measurable representational gap: decision-makers relying on public discourse as a proxy for stakeholder priorities will systematically underweight those most affected. We introduce a consensus-based semantic projection methodology that is currently being validated across domains and generalizes to other stakeholder-technology contexts.
