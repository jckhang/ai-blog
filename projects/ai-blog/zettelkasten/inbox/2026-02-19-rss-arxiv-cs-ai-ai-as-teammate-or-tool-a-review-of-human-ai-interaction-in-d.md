# AI as Teammate or Tool? A Review of Human-AI Interaction in Decision Support

> arXiv:2602.15865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) necessitates determining whether systems function as tools or collaborative teammates. In this study, by synthesizing Human-AI Interaction (HAI) literature, we analyze this distinction across four dimensions: interaction design, trust calibration, collaborative frameworks and healthcare applications. Our analysis reveals that static interfaces and miscalibrated trust limit AI efficacy. Performance hinges on aligning transparency with cognitive workflows, yet a fluency trap often inflates trust without improving decision-making. Consequently, an overemphasis on explainability leaves systems largely passive. Our findings show that current AI systems remain largely passive due to an overreliance on explainability-centric designs and that transitioning AI to an active teammate requires adaptive, context-aware interactions that support shared mental models and the dynamic negotiation of authority between humans and AI.
