# Lossless Vocabulary Reduction for Auto-Regressive Language Models

> arXiv:2510.08102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. This framework allows language models with different tokenization to cooperate with each other efficiently by reduction to their maximal common vocabulary. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate its applicability to model ensemble with different tokenization.
