# Random Scaling of Emergent Capabilities

> arXiv:2502.17356v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models famously improve under a smooth scaling law, but some specific capabilities exhibit sudden breakthroughs in performance. Advocates of "emergence" view these capabilities as unlocked at a specific scale, but others attribute breakthroughs to superficial metric thresholding effects. We propose that breakthroughs are instead driven by continuous changes in the probability distribution of training outcomes when performance is bimodally distributed across random seeds. we show that different random seeds can produce either smooth or emergent scaling trends in synthetic length generalization tasks, multiple choice question answering, and grammatical generalization. We reveal that sharp breakthroughs in metrics are produced by underlying continuous changes in their distribution across seeds. These distributions may become abruptly bimodal at a capacity threshold but this threshold appears at scales well before most seeds achieve breakthrough. Our observations hold true even under continuous loss metrics, confirming that random variation must be considered when predicting a model's performance from its scale.
