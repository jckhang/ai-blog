# Large Language Models for Water Distribution Systems Modeling and Decision-Making

> arXiv:2503.16191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into engineering workflows presents new opportunities for making computational tools more accessible. Especially where such tools remain underutilized due to technical or expertise barriers, such as water distribution system (WDS) management. This study introduces LLM-EPANET, an agent-based framework that enables natural language interaction with EPANET, the benchmark WDS simulator. The framework combines retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent orchestration to automatically translate user queries into executable code, run simulations, and return structured results. A curated set of 69 benchmark queries is introduced to evaluate performance across state-of-the-art LLMs. Results show that LLMs can effectively support a wide range of modeling tasks, achieving 56-81% accuracy overall, and over 90% for simpler queries. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based modeling to democratize data-driven decision-making in the water sector through transparent, interactive AI interfaces. The framework code and benchmark queries are shared as an open resource: https://github.com/yinon-gold/LLMs-in-WDS-Modeling.
