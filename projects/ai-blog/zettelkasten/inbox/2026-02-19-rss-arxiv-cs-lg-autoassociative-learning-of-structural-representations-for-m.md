# Autoassociative Learning of Structural Representations for Modeling and Classification in Medical Imaging

> arXiv:2411.12070v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning architectures based on convolutional neural networks tend to rely on continuous, smooth features. While this characteristics provides significant robustness and proves useful in many real-world tasks, it is strikingly incompatible with the physical characteristic of the world, which, at the scale in which humans operate, comprises crisp objects, typically representing well-defined categories. This study proposes a class of neurosymbolic systems that learn by reconstructing images in terms of visual primitives and are thus forced to form high-level, structural explanations of them. When applied to the task of diagnosing abnormalities in histological imaging, the method proved superior to a conventional deep learning architecture in terms of classification accuracy, while being more transparent.
