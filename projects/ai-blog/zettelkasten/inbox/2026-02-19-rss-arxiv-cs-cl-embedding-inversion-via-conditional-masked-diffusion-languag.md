# Embedding Inversion via Conditional Masked Diffusion Language Models

> arXiv:2602.11047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We frame embedding inversion as conditional masked diffusion, recovering all tokens in parallel through iterative denoising rather than sequential autoregressive generation. A masked diffusion language model is conditioned on the target embedding via adaptive layer normalization, requiring only 8 forward passes with no access to the target encoder at inference time. On 32-token sequences across three embedding models, the method achieves token recovery through parallel denoising without requiring encoder access, iterative correction, or architecture-specific alignment. Source code and live demo are available at https://github.com/jina-ai/embedding-inversion-demo.
