# Experience-based Knowledge Correction for Robust Planning in Minecraft

> arXiv:2505.24157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based planning has advanced embodied agents in long-horizon environments such as Minecraft, where acquiring latent knowledge of goal (or item) dependencies and feasible actions is critical. However, LLMs often begin with flawed priors and fail to correct them through prompting, even with feedback. We present XENON (eXpErience-based kNOwledge correctioN), an agent that algorithmically revises knowledge from experience, enabling robustness to flawed priors and sparse binary feedback. XENON integrates two mechanisms: Adaptive Dependency Graph, which corrects item dependencies using past successes, and Failure-aware Action Memory, which corrects action knowledge using past failures. Together, these components allow XENON to acquire complex dependencies despite limited guidance. Experiments across multiple Minecraft benchmarks show that XENON outperforms prior agents in both knowledge learning and long-horizon planning. Remarkably, with only a 7B open-weight LLM, XENON surpasses agents that rely on much larger proprietary models. Project page: https://sjlee-me.github.io/XENON
