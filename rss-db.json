      "description": "arXiv:2602.15831v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed as autonomous systems capable of planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration across complex tasks. However, existing agent-related protocols focus on agent-to-agent interactions, leaving humans as external observers rather than integrated participants within the agent systems. This limitation arises from the lack of a standardized mechanism for agents to discover, address, and interact with humans across heterogeneous messaging platforms. In this paper, we propose the A2H (Agent-to-Human) protocol, a unified protocol that enables humans to be registered, discovered, and communicated with by AI agents as resolvable entities within agent systems. A2H contributes three key components: (1) Human Card for registering human identities via resolvable domain names, making them discoverable to agents; (2) Formal Communication Schema defines when, why, and how agents contact with human;(3) Unified Messaging Abstraction standardizes diverse communication medias and transforms complex JSON outputs into human-friendly formats. This work establishes a foundational protocol for integrating humans into agent ecosystems, advancing AI agents from isolated autonomous systems toward truly human-connected intelligent infrastructures.",

      "description": "arXiv:2602.15832v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Existing user simulations, where models generate user-like responses in dialogue, often lack verification that sufficient user personas are provided, questioning the validity of the simulations. To address this core concern, this work explores the task of identifying relevant but unknown personas of the simulation target for a given simulation context. We introduce PICQ, a novel dataset of context-aware choice questions, annotated with unknown personas (e.g., ''Is the user price-sensitive?'') that may influence user choices, and propose a multi-faceted evaluation scheme assessing fidelity, influence, and inaccessibility. Our benchmark of leading LLMs reveals a complex ''Fidelity vs. Insight'' dilemma governed by model scale: while influence generally scales with model size, fidelity to human patterns follows an inverted U-shaped curve. We trace this phenomenon to cognitive differences, particularly the human tendency for ''cognitive economy.'' Our work provides the first comprehensive benchmark for this crucial task, offering a new lens for understanding the divergent cognitive models of humans and advanced LLMs.",

Existing studies have mainly focused on developing new glove prototypes or optimizing only one type of glove, without addressing the integration of both features.

      "description": "arXiv:2602.15834v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.",

Traditionally, user satisfaction and user experiences have been the primary metrics for evaluating dialogue systems.

So far, there has been no methodology for identifying these evaluation items. We propose identifying evaluation items based on business-dialogue system alignment models, which are applications of business-IT alignment models used in the development and operation of practical IT systems.

      "description": "arXiv:2602.15836v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) have shown immense potential in autonomous navigation by bridging high-level reasoning with low-level control. However, deploying these multi-billion parameter models on edge devices remains a significant challenge due to memory constraints and latency requirements. In this paper, we propose EdgeNav-QE, a novel framework that integrates Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) with a dynamic early-exit (DEE) mechanism to optimize LAMs for real-time edge navigation. By quantizing the backbone to 4-bit precision and strategically placing early-exit branches, we enable the model to terminate inference early for simple navigation tasks while retaining full depth for complex decision-making. Experimental results on the Habitat-Sim environment with Matterport3D dataset using OpenVLA-7B backbone, demonstrate that EdgeNav-QE reduces inference latency by 82.7% and memory footprint by 66.7% compared to full-precision baselines, while maintaining 81.8% navigation success rate. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art static early-exit method by 17.9% in latency, demonstrating the superiority of content-aware adaptive computation for safety-critical applications.",

      "description": "arXiv:2602.15837v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADS) are safety-critical and require rigorous testing before public deployment. Simulation-based scenario testing provides a safe and cost-effective alternative to extensive on-road trials, enabling efficient evaluation of ADS under diverse and high-risk conditions. However, existing approaches mainly evaluates the scenarios based on their proximity to collisions and focus on scenarios already close to collision, leaving many other hazardous situations unexplored. To bridge this, we introduce a collision-related concept of conflict as an intermediate search target and propose a two-stage scenario testing framework that first searches for conflicts and then mutates these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions. Evaluated on Baidu Apollo, our approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations thanks to conflict-targeted mutations. These results show that using conflicts as intermediate objectives broadens the search horizon and significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ADS safety evaluation.",

      "description": "arXiv:2602.15838v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multi-agent trajectory optimization with dense interaction networks require solving large coupled QPs at control rates, yet existing solvers fail to simultaneously exploit temporal structure, agent decomposition, and iteration similarity. One usually treats multi-agent problems monolithically when using general-purpose QP solvers (OSQP, MOSEK), which encounter scalability difficulties with agent count. Structure-exploiting solvers (HPIPM) leverage temporal structure through Riccati recursion but can be vulnerable to dense coupling constraints. We introduce TurboADMM, a specialized single-machine QP solver that achieves empirically near linear complexity in agent count through systematic co-design of three complementary components: (1) ADMM decomposition creates per-agent subproblems solvable in parallel, preserving block-tridiagonal structure under dense coupling; (2) Riccati warmstart exploits temporal structure to provide high-quality primal-dual initialization for each agent's QP; (3) parametric QP hotstart \\footnote{In the paper, we refer warmstart as the technique that uses the Riccati equation results as auxiliary QP initialization for a single QP solve, while hotstart as reusing the QR factorization across QP solve iterations.}in qpOASES reuses similar KKT system factorizations across ADMM iterations.",

An alternative approach is to help young people develop the skills they need to manage online safety while preserving the benefits of online interactions. This dissertation presents the entire development process and evaluation of an multi-platform application, called EmoTrack that aims to help young people reflect on their online behaviour. It was developed to record their online activities and cultivate strategies for more positive and mindful engagement online. EmoTrack is a personal informatics system, and it is designed to help people track and reflect on their engagement with YouTube videos. The system was evaluated with thirteen participants and it was found that EmoTrack can facilitate them to reflect on their video watching behaviour and the impact on their mood, with reports of different levels of reflections from R0 to R3.",

      "description": "arXiv:2602.15840v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Over the past decade, extended reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, gained attention as a research instrument in human-robot interaction studies, but remains underexplored in empirical investigations of social robotics. To map the field, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from 2015 to 2025. Of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles, only 33 met strict inclusion criteria. We examined (1) how XR and virtual social robots are used and in which contexts, (2) data collection and analysis methods, (3) demographics of the researchers and participants, and (4) the stated challenges and future agendas. Our findings show that social XR-HRI research is still dominated by laboratory simulations, while crucial specifications like used hardware, software, and robots are often not reported. Robots typically act as passive and less interactive visual stimuli, while the rich biosignal (e.g., eye-tracking) and logging functions of modern head-mounted displays remain largely untapped. The research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, and male, with frequent gaps in demographic reporting. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short, shallow study cycles. We propose a five-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium, which includes fostering methodological innovation, a reinforced ecological validity by, e.g., using application contexts, the improvement of the robot's interaction quality, promoting diversity in the sample and the development of a social XR-HRI taxonomy. Advancing in these directions is essential for XR to mature from a lab prototype into an ecologically valid research instrument for social robotics.",

Reward hacking exists because RL environments are often imperfect, and it is fundamentally challenging to accurately specify a reward function.\nWith the rise of language models generalizing to a broad spectrum of tasks and RLHF becomes a de facto method for alignment training, reward hacking in RL training of language models has become a critical practical challenge. Instances where the model learns to modify unit tests to pass coding tasks, or where responses contain biases that mimic a user’s preference, are pretty concerning and are likely one of the major blockers for real-world deployment of more autonomous use cases of AI models.",

As a term, hallucination has been somewhat generalized to cases when the model makes mistakes. Here, I would like to narrow down the problem of hallucination to cases where the model output is fabricated and not grounded by either the provided context or world knowledge.\nThere are two types of hallucination:\nIn-context hallucination: The model output should be consistent with the source content in context.\nExtrinsic hallucination: The model output should be grounded by the pre-training dataset. However, given the size of the pre-training dataset, it is too expensive to retrieve and identify conflicts per generation. If we consider the pre-training data corpus as a proxy for world knowledge, we essentially try to ensure the model output is factual and verifiable by external world knowledge. Equally importantly, when the model does not know about a fact, it should say so.\nThis post focuses on extrinsic hallucination. To avoid hallucination, LLMs need to be (1) factual and (2) acknowledge not knowing the answer when applicable.",

Later simplified Transformer was shown to achieve great performance in language modeling tasks, like in encoder-only BERT or decoder-only GPT.",

They are powerful but very expensive to train and use. The extremely high inference cost, in both time and memory, is a big bottleneck for adopting a powerful transformer for solving real-world tasks at scale.\nWhy is it hard to run inference for large transformer models? Besides the increasing size of SoTA models, there are two main factors contributing to the inference challenge (Pope et al. 2022):",
